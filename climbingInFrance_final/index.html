      <p>Early summer time is the best time for me climbing in the south east of France. Particularly the day gets 
          longer so you have a longer outdoor time to climb, and the weather is pleasant and less crowded than summer time.
          <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/france/ceuse">Ceuse</a> is a well-known world-class sport climbing area.
          Even though there are many professional and amateur climbers from many countries climbing in Ceuse, it is still full 
          of a friendly atmosphere.</p>

      <p>My favorite climbing area is <a
              href="https://www.thecrag.com/en/climbing/france/saint-leger-gorges">Saint Leger</a> because there are lovely 
          people living in the small village near the crag in Saint Leger, and we became friends by the end of my stay.</p>
